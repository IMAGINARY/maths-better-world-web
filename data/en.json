      "body": "When a new epidemic starts one can fear that it will not stop since there are always new cases. This is not what mathematics says. The important quantity is the reproductive ratio, R_0, which corresponds to the mean number of individuals infected by each infectious person. If R_0 < 1, then the epidemic dies, while it spreads if R_0 > 1. The knowledge of R_0 guides the strategy to control the epidemic. In particular, in case of limited resources (for instance not enough vaccines for everyone), the goal is to use these resources to decrease R_0 below 1.",

For instance the first significant digit of 23.567 is 2, and that of 0.00345 is 3. You should get approximately 30% of digit 1 and only 4.5% of digit 9. This surprising phenomenon is called Benford’s law. It is a probabilistic law. Most often the numbers in financial statements follow this law, which gives a test for detecting frauds when someone has manipulated the data, without taking care that they follow the law.",

But we, as humans, are not taught of everything we can do. We learn by ourselves. A kid that has seen many cats can recognize that an animal is a cat even it that animal is different from all the models seen before. Now robots can do the same. The recent success of artificial intelligence comes from the fact that the robots are programmed to learn. This learning process is made possible because of the massive data available.",

The Fourier transform allows us to split a complex sound wave into many simple ones. Audio formats like MP3 only keep the audible frequencies, thus making the files much smaller. Without mathematics there would be no iPods, Spotify or iTunes.",

Statistics can also tell us if certain findings are valid or significant.",
