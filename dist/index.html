If R_0 < 1, then the epidemic dies, while it spreads if R_0 > 1. The knowledge of R_0 guides the strategy to control the epidemic. In particular, in case of limited resources (for instance not enough vaccines for everyone), the goal is to use these resources to decrease R_0 below 1.","links":"https://www.mathscareers.org.uk/article/number-one-crime-fighter/"},{"id":"artificial_intelligence","title":"Artificial Intelligence","body":"Where does its sudden success come from?

A kid that has seen many cats can recognize that an animal is a cat even it that animal is different from all the models seen before. Now robots can do the same. The recent success of artificial intelligence comes from the fact that the robots are programmed to learn. This learning process is made possible because of the massive data available.","links":""},{"id":"digital_music","title":"Digital Music","body":"Music consists of waves that vibrate in our ears. These waves can be stored on a CD as a string of numbers, by taking samples at short time intervals – usually 44100 times per second.\n\nSound waves are the combination of many waves with different frequencies, some not even perceived by our ears. The Fourier transform allows us to split a complex sound wave into many simple ones. Audio formats like MP3 only keep the audible frequencies, thus making the files much smaller.

All planes, all luggage, every crew and all passengers have to be at the right place at the right time. Most importantly, planes can’t crash when arriving at any of the busy airports. This is an incredibly complex logistic challenge, impossible without mathematics and Operations research.\n\nIn addition, airlines want to save money by creating a more efficient network in which planes take the best possible routes and in which planes are never idle, empty or out of service. This can be done using algorithms from Graph theory.","links":"https://www.mathscareers.org.uk/article/aircraft-scheduling/\nhttps://mathigon.org/course/graph-theory/introduction"},{"id":"glacier_melting","title":"Glacier Melting","body":"The melting of the polar icecaps impacts the global sea level and climate.\n\nUnfortunately, satellite images from above give limited information regarding the state of the entire ice shield or the processes underlying their melting. Probability and statistics can be used to analyse environmental data, for example of ice thickness and composition.\n\nMathematical models using differential equations and thermodynamics help to understand the interaction of wind, sea ice, ocean currents and heat transfer.","links":"https://plus.maths.org/content/maths-and-climate-change-melting-arctic\nhttp://www.ams.org/notices/200905/tx090500562p.pdf\nhttps://www.mathscareers.org.uk/article/taking-earths-temperature/\nhttps://imaginary.org/program/future-of-glaciers-the-module"},{"id":"problem_solving","title":"Problem Solving","body":"Most of the items on this website show real life applications of mathematics. But even just the process of doing mathematics is important: it teaches structured thinking, logical reasoning, abstraction, and the ability to express ideas in a precise language.\n\nThese skills are valuable not only in science and engineering, but in every single other discipline – whether in politics, journalism, music and arts, management, law, or anywhere else.","links":"http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5837/AIM-249.pdf"},{"id":"tsunami_warning","title":"Tsunami warning","body":"An earthquake just happened. Will it trigger a tsunami? If yes, which coasts will be hit and when? Mathematical modeling allows understanding the propagation of a tsunami, once the epicenter of the earthquake is located. Indeed, the speed of the tsunami is proportional to the square of the depth of the ocean. A tsunami can go unnoticed on the high seas. When approaching a coast the depth decreases, thus allowing the piling up of the water up to impressive heights. Once the modeling is finished, alerts can be sent to the exposed regions.","links":"http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/mathmoments/mm88-tsunami-podcast"},{"id":"group_testing","title":"Group testing","body":"To control the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to detect asymptomatic carriers through extensive testing. This can be very expensive to detect only a few infected. A better technique is to do group testing: people are divided into groups, and a mix of samples from each group is tested. If the mix is negative, then no individual in the group is infected. If the mix is positive, then each person in the group needs to be tested to identify the positives. If one individual in 100 is infected, it can be found with only 25 tests (instead of 100) by using groups of 20 people.","links":"http://accromath.uqam.ca/volume/journee-internationale-des-mathematiques-accromath-multilingue/\nhttps://www.idm314.org/resources/activities/idm-group-screening-en.pdf"},{"id":"cell_antennas","title":"Cell phone antennas","body":"You want to cover a large territory with cell phone antennas so that any point has an antenna no farther than a certain distance. What is the most economical way of doing it? It has been shown that the most economical way is to put the antennas at the vertices of a tiling of equilateral triangles. Using a square tiling would require (3√3)⁄4≈1.299 more antennas, and using a hexagonal tiling, twice as much."},{"id":"telescope_mirrors","title":"Telescope mirrors","body":"Humans always dreamed to see further into the universe. This requires to condense the light emitted by the celestial bodies. Condensing a parallel beam of light into a beam converging to one point requires a parabolic mirror. A hyperbolic mirror changes the direction of a convergent beam and an elliptic mirror transforms a divergent beam emitted by one point into a convergent beam. Most telescopes use a primary mirror, which is parabolic, and at least one secondary mirror, but sometimes more than one. The latter often have the shape of a conic.","links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djkBahaEHG4"},{"id":"game_theory","title":"Game theory","body":"What is the best strategy to win a game? What is the best interest of a company or of a country? Well, to decide it, you better take into consideration that your partners are intelligent. This could bring some companies or governments to cooperate, because some form of cooperation is more advantageous than competition. John Nash, a mathematician and Nobel Prize in economics, introduced the notion of Nash equilibrium as a strategy in a non-cooperative game. There, each player is able to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player can do better by changing only their own strategy.","links":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-game-theory-and-w/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHS-htjGgSY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3oWYHYoBvk"},{"id":"fair_division","title":"Fair division","body":"Sharing a pizza between guests in equal portions is not necessarily optimal: some will have too much, while others will still be hungry. A fair division is one in which every partner is equally satisfied with their lot. And, if we also have salad, perhaps some will want less pizza and more salad. In the theory of fair division, there is an interest in analyzing these kinds of problems mathematically. There are many applications, especially for developing government policies to maximize equity among citizens.","links":"https://www.idm314.org/resources/activities/idm-fair-division-en.pdf\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaMKInkV7Vs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBVg8x4LWZE"},{"id":"insurance","title":"Insurance","body":"The underlying principle of insurance is to mix risk. If a million people take out insurance for their homes and only 1,000 homeowners make a claim, this allows each insured to assume a risk of only 0.1% of the cost of the average claim price. On the other hand, an insured can have their home replaced if it is declared a total loss. To calculate the cost of premiums, insurance companies must estimate the cost of future damage and add their operating costs. The cost of damage can fluctuate significantly from one year to the next, depending on the natural disasters that strike a region."}];
